# hybridVAE.jl

This repository contains all the scripts and data sets that were used to write the thesis.

### Datasets
The data sets that were used are contained in the first four files, i.e. Fox, Musk1, Musk2 and Tiger.

### CV_MIL.jl
performs CV either discriminatively, or via hybrid approach

###  poly_reg_hybrid.jl
performs exercise for improvement of polynomial regression via generative regularization

### my_vae.jl
performs the simple experiment for generating data 

### hybridVAE_nmoons.jl
tests the hybrid VAE aprroach for synthetic nmoons data

### hybridVAE_MIL.jl
computes AUC-ROC for MIL using hybridVAE

### hybrid_vs_discr_MIL.jl
computes AUC--ROC for MIL using hybrid or discriminative method

### NCE_binary_gauss.jl
estimates the 1D gaussian distribution using noise contrastive esimation

### NCE_binary_gauss2D.jl
estimates the 2D gaussian distribution using noise contrastive esimation
